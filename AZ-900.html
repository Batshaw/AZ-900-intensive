<h2>Module 1: Cloud Concepts</h2>

<h3>I. Key cloud concepts & cloud computing terms</h3>

<h4>1. What is Cloud computing?</h4>
<p><b>Cloud computing</b> is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Compute power</b> meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments...</li>
    <li><b>Storage</b> like files and/or databases.</li>
    <li><b>Networking</b> i nAzure but also outside when connecting to your company network.</li>
    <li><b>Analytics</b> is services for visualization and telemetry data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Key Characteristics of Cloud</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Scalability:</b>
        Scaling is the process of adding or removing resources. Resource could be a virtual resources, instances of resources.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Vertical Scaling</b> (Scaling up/down)
                lets you increase or decrease computing power or databases as needed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Horizontal scaling</b> (Scaling out/in)
                entails adding more databases or dividing a large database into smaller nodes, using a data partitioning approach called sharding.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Elasticity</b> (automatic scaling) is the ability to scale dynamically.</li>
    <li><b>Agility</b> is the ability to allocate and deallocate resources quickly.</li>
    <li><b>Fault Tolerance</b> is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failures.</li>
    <li><b>Disaster Recovery</b> is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service.</li>
    <li><b>High availability</b> is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime.
        <p>Availability = Uptime/(Uptime + Downtime)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>II. Principles of economies of scale</h3>

<h4>Key Characteristics -> one of the cloud benefits</h4>
<p>Cost per unit (service) lowers as the size of the company grows.</p>

<h3>III. CapEx & OpEx</h3>

<h4>1. Capital Expenditure - CapEx</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Buying your <b>own</b> infrastructure</li>
    <li>Big <b>initial investment</b></li>
    <li>Lots of <b>maintenance</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Support staff</li>
            <li>Power & networking</li>
            <li>Hardware failures</li>
            <li>others...</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul> 

<h4>2. Operational Expenditure - OpEx</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Rent</b> infrastructure</li>
    <li><b>No initial investment</b>, pay for what you use</li>
    <li>Minimal maintenance
        <ul>
            <li>Operations team: to manage most important tasks around your infrastructure</li>
            <li>Microsoft manages everything else and this is included in the price</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>IV. Consumption-based Model</h3>
<p>How is Azure pricing the services?</p>
<p><b>Consumption</b> is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used.\<br>
    Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer best possible pricing model.\<br>
    Those metrics are tracked on very granular level.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No associated upfront costs</li>
    <li>No wasted resources</li>
    <li>Pay for additional resources when needed</li>
    <li>Stop paying at any time/ when you don't use</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Multiple pricinhg components per service
        <ul>
            <li>Compute: Power/size of the virtual machine</li>
            <li>Storage: store data</li>
            <li>Network: based on the complexity of the service</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Very granular usage measurement</li>
</ul>
